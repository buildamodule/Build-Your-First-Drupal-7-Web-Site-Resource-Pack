"Build Your First Drupal 7 Web Site" Video Series Resource Pack
===================================================

This is the collection of files that are used in the "[Build Your First Drupal 7 Web Site](http://buildamodule.com/collection/build-your-first-drupal-7-web-site)" video collection on [BuildAModule](http://buildamodule.com). In this collection, we cover the most important concepts of working with Drupal for the absolute beginner, including:

* How to install and uninstall modules
* How to work with users and permissions
* How to create and organize content types
* How to adjust the CSS of any page

Many of the files here use a custom '.step' extension, which are referred to as 'step files'. This convention allows you to open all of the files in the editor of your choice, allows us to make hidden files visible, and makes it clear that the name of the step file is not the name of the final file that you will be using.

Enjoy!
